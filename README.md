# Redclazz's Website

This is my website's repo!

As you can tell, it's been build with Vue, Vite and TS. I'm no frontend dev but I did try my best! Turns out my HTML and CSS aren't as bad as I think (ofc copilot helped me).

I've redesigned the page to improve its appearance and make it more visually appealing and easier to navigate. Hope you enjoy!
