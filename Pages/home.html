<h3>What's the web about?</h3>
<p>
    This is the first text ever written for my website! The whole idea of opening a website is to
    practice some web dev skills and write a functional API for this. As you can probably see
    design is not
    my strong suit, but I really did try my best with CSS and the whole gruvbox/retro theming.

    Inspiration for this website came from 90s personal blogs people used to update on
    geocities. So I hope I'm able to capture some of that feeling!
